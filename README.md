# Jiahua Xu's personal website

This repository contains code for my personal website: https://jiahua-xu.com/.

I used [Much-Worse jekyll theme](https://github.com/gchauras/much-worse-jekyll-theme), and received tremendous support from [@danhper](https://github.com/danhper) in setting up this website.

## How to

```zsh
git clone https://github.com/xujiahuayz/xujiahuayz.github.io.git
```

nevigate to the repo directory
```zsh
cd xujiahuayz.github.io.git
```

install `bundler` if you haven't
```zsh
sudo gem install bundler
```

run locally
```
bundle exec jekyll serve
```
